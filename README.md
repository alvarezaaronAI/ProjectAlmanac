# ProjectAlmanac
This project is meant to create a simple website that allows students to create a 4 year road to success calendar. This website allows them to track and update the classes they want to take in which semester, if they don't have an idea, we suggest the classes in which a student can take in each semester. Is meant to be a simple website for new incoming students and continuing students can use.
